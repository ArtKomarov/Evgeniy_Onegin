‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
(Critics stern, acute as any)
(The place where we began, you see)
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
A London dandy safely classed
A birthday party, here a ball.
A bit of this a bit of that,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
A distant strand of singing soars;
A flow of silhouetted stills,
A full three hours at least he’d spend
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
A host of nymphs around her, so
A mazurka holds the crowd;
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
A pedant in the details, no less. 
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
A single boat with outspread oars
A walk beside the lonely lake,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
Across the literary stack,
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Again imagination blazes,
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Ah, they made me long despair
Alas, on every stray amusement
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
All attentive, or just mumble! 
All chained to their pre-conception,
All in our sage’s cell appears
All is still, only the guards
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 
All mankind’s malicious ways
All night, barely a foot away!
All poets, it seems to me,
All serious effort – no words flow,
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Always gave three balls a year
An instant hails the entrechat,
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
And captive girls by the Salgira,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
And creditors had him at bay,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
And died with all he owed unmet.
And everything Parisian taste,
And fail to offer a word, to make
And far niente is my law.
And for you, knowledgeable race,
And gladly lived a life of debt
And ignominiously repeat
And kept dull boredom far away –
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
And my Eugene was free at last,
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
And our Katenin moreover
And so in careless rapture I
And spirit finds creative fire.
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
And though a womaniser fine,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
And to delight the sensual
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
And turning morning into night
And we can all display éclat,
And when he wanted to refer
And with southern oceans nigh
And, exiled for that very thing
Another day I bring to mind!
Another slowly circling, so
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 
Are you as you were? Have new
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
As ardent glances swiftly fly
As at the feast he seemed to be?
As emptiness possessed his soul,
As for finding ancient treasure
As his horses plough the dust,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 
As some suspicious aged devil,
As though we can never treat
As well-read, but opinionated,
Askance his opera-glass now centres
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
At that time, and retired from view,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Await the touch, involuntary,
Before the mirror, then would leave
Before you, let him now advance.
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
Benediction we drank deep!
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel, 
Better to hurry to the ball,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
Blue columns rising over folk,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Borne away to change at home. 
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Both had known the play of passion
Both had wearied of the game, 
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
But Petersburg that restless heap
But as for genius, if any,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
But later found it re-assuring,
But now my friends I often hear,
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
But still found nothing in his head,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
But was dear Yevgeny content
But where, in what deserted strand
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
But, God, what tedium to sample
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
Call to each other in the yards,
Cannot but despise it all,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Carried in dream to that land where
Catch the first flush of emotion,
China and bronzes fill the table,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Content forever with their life,
Content with life, took a stance,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
Crunching over morning snow.
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Dear liberty and leisure.
Deep in all things economic
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Did all that was required to please.
Did full justice to the rest,
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Each falling there as they form
Each man to his own ideas,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
Every dawn produces more
Exhausted by society,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Faithlessness was not amusing
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Far from Italy’s allure. 
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Finding it small deprivation,
First Madame, you understand,
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
For I stopped sinning long ago.
For all those years long sped by?
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
For conversation’s art created.
For idleness and sense to waste –
For rural silence, where the lyre
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
For two days it was all quite new,
For whom among that jealous crowd,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Free, and in the flower of youth, 
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Friends and enemies from afar
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
From Romulus to our own day,
From every pleasure he retreated,
From his uncle’s man, to say
From my words take warning due,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Garbed to the modern taste,
Generally their conversation
Glad now that his former ways
Glass on glass to drench the heat
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Go, little book: find Neva then,
God be thanked, some imitation,
Great shelves of books he read and read
Guard your daughters most severely,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Happy is he who can employ
Has opened up his serving flap.
Hating all this litigation,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
He breathes the air of freedom, at
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
He even felt the urge to yawn,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
He knew enough I would allow
He lacked the passion and desire
He notes the boxes, serried places,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
He saunters on the Boulevard,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who had never once concealed
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
He with lawyers round his ears,
He would neglect and then abandon.
He yawned inordinately, and so
He’d no desire to dig the dust
He’d wander through a drawing room,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
Heads, in profile, edges crop, 
Her way again in soulful flight?
Here no conscience, there no sense,
Here without an ounce of bother,
His beaver-collar shines away, 
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
His epigrams topped up with bile. 
His father had a fine career
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
His glance now bold, with tender art,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
His heart consumed with regret
His labour, torment and delight,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
His springtime occupation bright,
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
His uncle’s frail mortality.  
His unique eccentricity,
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
How I envied the waves then,
How I longed to be those seas
How languid was his reticence,
How often, on a summer’s night,
How passionate his eloquence,
How poisonous the words he used!
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
How swift his letters from the heart!
How utterly himself forgetting!
I dare to write about it so,
I hear the magic of your voice!
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
I liked his face, his manner too,
I love their little feet, confess   
I love youth’s frantic energy,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
I might try to tell the whole tale,
I once spent my sweetest days?
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
I still remember, and it seems
I suffered without hope or joy.
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
I too cast off the social burden,
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
I was born for quiet existence
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
In both our hearts a dying flame,
In days of dream and ardour,
In ease and innocence I take
In fact he soon received a letter
In happiness, in idle ways,
In his memory tucked away.
In human rights, was here all wrong. 
In masculine attire displayed
In order to be heard more clearly.
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
In the end he too grew bored
In the morning of our days. 
In the springtime on the moss,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
In winter, resting on the fender,
Ingenious London without cease
Ingenuous naivety,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Into society he rode.
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Istomina stands, serious
It summons up respect, one can
It’s not my job to work them through.
It’s peppered with them to excess,
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Land of bewitchment! In past times
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Latin’s not in fashion now,
Leaning, musing pensively,
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Let us all follow his example!
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Like a shadow, or a wife. 
Like prisoners released in sleep,
Like women, books proved a deception,
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Listen now to my sad voice.
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
Love in imagination,
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
Madman, could your heart forget?
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Meet my hero of romance,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Monotonous and varied, say,
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
More than once in white night-cap
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
My country: exile was my lot,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
My lips from hers will softly prove
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
My services to you I vow!
My songs inspired by that crowd.
My soul preserved its memory
My style is rendered quite absurd
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Nature’s debt already paid.
No Russian terms exist, confess,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
No longer even stirred his will, 
No need to keep reserves of gold.
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
No reason why a man of energy
No, for his early feelings faded,
No, never in the fiercest fires
No, passion took no greater toll,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Not for long were lovely ladies
Nothing touched his feelings there,
Now free, my verse no longer feared 
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
Now, when Eugene reached the age
O country life! I like you all,
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Of history all turned to rust,
Of how it lives, the what and why
Of lovely woman, freakish fop. 
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
Of over-elaborate slander try
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
Of someone other, never own
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Of tortured youth and its desires
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
On any fond face on this stage,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
On the granite parapet,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
On what spring flowers are you set?
On what the state relies, he told,
Once more resigned to being idle
One foot planted, pirouettes
One thing alone he studied well,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Onegin has outpaced us all.  
Onegin, he was deemed by many
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
Onegin, to the theatre where
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
Or else, reviewing distantly,
Or end a letter with vale,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
Or frighten with a glance or two
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Or the granite of the shore.
Orchestra already tiring,
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
Over the darkened stones instead,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Pampered in eastern luxury
Parading there with all the rest,
Past the doorman like an arrow,
Pay attention now I beg you,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Plus another hidden reason,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Produced his hive of comedy,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Recall the sea before a storm,
Recalling many a lost love there
Recalling romance of time past,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Rewards with its fond caress
Roam beneath my African sky,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Satire’s most audacious master,
Say farewell without delay.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Secure a secret assignation,
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
Sentimental, free from care,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Silently impart love’s teaching!
Silently to yawn and sigh
Since even he at times would sigh
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
So he’ll double the intensity
So inflexible, so virtuous,
So unapproachable, serene,
So youth’s happiness must pass,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Such our young dog’s meditation,
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Taught him everything by whim,
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 
Thank God no desire claimed him,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
That Onegin is not me, recall 
That dressing room, all solitary,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
That occupied each night and day,
That sitting by the bed all day,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
That, search all Russia though,
The Academic Dictionary. 
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
The Muse gave it eternity,
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
The careful spouse as much his man,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
The censors must have work to do.
The child of luxury and delight.
The circle claps to make all happen, 
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
The coachmen by the fire free
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
The corpse on a table laid,
The country caused the same ennui
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
The dance-floor was my passion:
The dead man buried priest and guests
The girls in fashionable dress,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The house was filled with commotion,
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The little foot I touch it seems;
The merchant and the beggar rise,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
The new ones simply antiquated,
The object of his constancy;
The old ones utterly out-dated,
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 
The punctilious German baker,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
The rustling curtain as we breathe
The safest place for a lover
The science of the tender passion
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
The solitariness of the meadow,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
The storm that shook my soul for years
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The twin lights of the carriage throw
The useful arts, can devise,
The wealth of nations was his topic;
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
Their absent masters to berate. 
Their dinner-table and their wife. 
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Their very presence causes spleen.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Then Monsieur taught the child
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
Then his father passed away,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Then like a very sage could seem
Then off to ramble in the park.
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
There I too strolled to and fro:
There beside the Neva’s shore,
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
This hostile climate where I wander,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Though I’m an adept at description,
Though I’ve consulted frequently
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Though it adds to conversation,
Though it’s true some woman may
Though the North affects me so.
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Threads the rows among the feet,
Three houses offer a soirée:
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Tired of the laughter of the age,
To all unfaithful by and by,
To any but ourselves alone. 
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
To dream affection constantly
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
To enter on the masquerade.
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To give his life for poetry,
To his rivals, that whole set,
To his stand the cabman drives,
To journalists for their consumption
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
To pair Yevgeny and I,
To pass a note of assignation.
To read an epigraph, and might
To roam the forests green, so us,
To tell iambic from trochee.
To the magic bow in thrall,
Today we know, truth to tell
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
Too often by a foreign word,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Treading the boards interminably,
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Turning on the alien mass
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
Was it for you all that distress? 
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
We’ve all acquired some education
Were changing with the passing days.
Were ever dearest friends of his,
What more is needed? All agreed
What traps he set for those abused!
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
When talk was of some graver matter,
When will my wings begin to soar?
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
Where my heart has long been smothered. 
Where no face showed of Diana
Where will my young idler call?
Where you too were nourished or
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Which to visit first? No matter,
While behind the window streams
While both indoors and outside
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
While drowned by frantic violins
While weary servants half-awake,
Who in your verse is your goddess?’
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
With some fair Venetian face,
With some ready epigram. 
With staple products its supply,
With that pale diaphanous light,
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
With witticisms forged with guile,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
Would join the literary bores,
Yawning the while as he raced,
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Yet were they wholly innocent
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
You left no trace, but loved instead
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
You were the first, capricious belles,
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
You’re curious for every detail,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Your question ringing in my ear,
-----------------------------

Three houses offer a soirée:
To pair Yevgeny and I,
And so in careless rapture I
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
But still found nothing in his head,
Over the darkened stones instead,
Great shelves of books he read and read
You left no trace, but loved instead
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
And to delight the sensual
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
With some ready epigram. 
The careful spouse as much his man,
It summons up respect, one can
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
But Petersburg that restless heap
Has opened up his serving flap.
More than once in white night-cap
When will my wings begin to soar?
Always gave three balls a year
But now my friends I often hear,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Your question ringing in my ear,
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Friends and enemies from afar
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
Each man to his own ideas,
How I longed to be those seas
As though we can never treat
An instant hails the entrechat,
And ignominiously repeat
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
And we can all display éclat,
Glass on glass to drench the heat
As his watch’s chimes repeat
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
A bit of this a bit of that,
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
And far niente is my law.
That sitting by the bed all day,
Then his father passed away,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
In his memory tucked away.
And kept dull boredom far away –
And creditors had him at bay,
Monotonous and varied, say,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
All night, barely a foot away!
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Say farewell without delay.
From his uncle’s man, to say
His beaver-collar shines away, 
From Romulus to our own day,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Though it’s true some woman may
That occupied each night and day,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
As at the feast he seemed to be?
And gladly lived a life of debt
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
For all those years long sped by?
To all unfaithful by and by,
Listen now to my sad voice.
Relinquished his inheritance,
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Content with life, took a stance,
Meet my hero of romance,
Before you, let him now advance.
I hear the magic of your voice!
And daze the eyes of innocence,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
I was born for quiet existence
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
How passionate his eloquence,
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
How languid was his reticence,
With some fair Venetian face,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Across the literary stack,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
So blameless in their intellect,
So clever, and so circumspect,
The object of his constancy;
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
To enter on the masquerade.
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
While both indoors and outside
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
The censors must have work to do.
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Call to each other in the yards,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
All is still, only the guards
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
Produced his hive of comedy,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
In masculine attire displayed
In the end he too grew bored
Where my heart has long been smothered. 
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
He who had never once concealed
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
The new ones simply antiquated,
Yawning the while as he raced,
A London dandy safely classed
The old ones utterly out-dated,
How poisonous the words he used!
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
Now free, my verse no longer feared 
No, for his early feelings faded,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
From every pleasure he retreated,
What more is needed? All agreed
What traps he set for those abused!
As well-read, but opinionated,
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
For conversation’s art created.
To tell iambic from trochee.
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
The coachmen by the fire free
(The place where we began, you see)
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel, 
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Then like a very sage could seem
I made a friend of Eugene then.
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
How I envied the waves then,
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
Go, little book: find Neva then,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
Their very presence causes spleen.
The circle claps to make all happen, 
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
Shall I depict with faithful pen
I too cast off the social burden,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
Benediction we drank deep!
And our Katenin moreover
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
Here without an ounce of bother,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
Which to visit first? No matter,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
When talk was of some graver matter,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
This hostile climate where I wander,
When shall I ever loose my tether?
Twists her waist one way, another,
His father had a fine career
In fact he soon received a letter
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
Satire’s most audacious master,
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
And when he wanted to refer
The punctilious German baker,
In winter, resting on the fender,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
The safest place for a lover
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Would join the literary bores,
Again imagination blazes,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
No, never in the fiercest fires
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Of tortured youth and its desires
Not for long were lovely ladies
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
Land of bewitchment! In past times
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
One foot planted, pirouettes
Askance his opera-glass now centres
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
To his stand the cabman drives,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
On what spring flowers are you set?
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
On the granite parapet,
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
Threads the rows among the feet,
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
His heart consumed with regret
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
To his rivals, that whole set,
Madman, could your heart forget?
And died with all he owed unmet.
At that time, and retired from view,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Are you as you were? Have new
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
For two days it was all quite new,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Like a shadow, or a wife. 
Their dinner-table and their wife. 
Content forever with their life,
On any fond face on this stage,
Now, when Eugene reached the age
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
That, search all Russia though,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
It’s not my job to work them through.
Silently to yawn and sigh
Since even he at times would sigh
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
And with southern oceans nigh
For I stopped sinning long ago.
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
I love youth’s frantic energy,
No reason why a man of energy
The rustling curtain as we breathe
Enchantment fails such men as he,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
How often, on a summer’s night,
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
And turning morning into night
He who feels, is quickly taught
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
To read an epigraph, and might
With that pale diaphanous light,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
The child of luxury and delight.
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His labour, torment and delight,
His springtime occupation bright,
Her way again in soulful flight?
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Of how it lives, the what and why
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
The wealth of nations was his topic;
When inspired again, ecstatic,
Deep in all things economic
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Nature’s debt already paid.
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
The corpse on a table laid,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
As some suspicious aged devil,
You’re curious for every detail,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Taught him everything by whim,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Ah, they made me long despair
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Were ever dearest friends of his,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
While weary servants half-awake,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
And fail to offer a word, to make
A walk beside the lonely lake,
In ease and innocence I take
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Roam beneath my African sky,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Then Monsieur taught the child
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
On what the state relies, he told,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
But, God, what tedium to sample
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
Let us all follow his example!
Once more resigned to being idle
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Or end a letter with vale,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
All attentive, or just mumble! 
China and bronzes fill the table,
With witticisms forged with guile,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
His epigrams topped up with bile. 
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Blue columns rising over folk,
That Onegin is not me, recall 
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
Cannot but despise it all,
To the magic bow in thrall,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
O country life! I like you all,
Today we know, truth to tell
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
Onegin has outpaced us all.  
One thing alone he studied well,
No longer even stirred his will, 
Better to hurry to the ball,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
A birthday party, here a ball.
Where will my young idler call?
No, passion took no greater toll,
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Leaning, musing pensively,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Treading the boards interminably,
Though I’ve consulted frequently
To dream affection constantly
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
In order to be heard more clearly.
With staple products its supply,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
As ardent glances swiftly fly
Guard your daughters most severely,
Both had wearied of the game, 
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 
Touching lightly on each theme,
In both our hearts a dying flame,
All poets, it seems to me,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Borne away to change at home. 
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
The little foot I touch it seems;
I still remember, and it seems
While behind the window streams
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
Where no face showed of Diana
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
Another day I bring to mind!
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
A full three hours at least he’d spend
First Madame, you understand,
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
But where, in what deserted strand
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
So unapproachable, serene,
And though a womaniser fine,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
To any but ourselves alone. 
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Orchestra already tiring,
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
And, exiled for that very thing
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
Silently impart love’s teaching!
But later found it re-assuring,
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
In human rights, was here all wrong. 
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
How utterly himself forgetting!
Enters. The room is gyring,
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Faithlessness was not amusing
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
Then he turns away – and yawns,
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Alas, on every stray amusement
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 
Yet were they wholly innocent
But was dear Yevgeny content
But as for genius, if any,
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
(Critics stern, acute as any)
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
Though it adds to conversation,
We’ve all acquired some education
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Such our young dog’s meditation,
The science of the tender passion
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
The house was filled with commotion,
Though I’m an adept at description,
Like women, books proved a deception,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
Finding it small deprivation,
All chained to their pre-conception,
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
To journalists for their consumption
Love in imagination,
The dance-floor was my passion:
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
To pass a note of assignation.
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Both had known the play of passion
He would neglect and then abandon.
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Plus another hidden reason,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
God be thanked, some imitation,
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
Secure a secret assignation,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
Generally their conversation
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Hating all this litigation,
Overcome with wit and passion,
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The coolness of the dark glades too,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
I liked his face, his manner too,
Heads, in profile, edges crop, 
Of lovely woman, freakish fop. 
Or her breast, filled with languor;
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
Where you too were nourished or
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
My country: exile was my lot,
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
Pay attention now I beg you,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
He knew enough I would allow
Past the doorman like an arrow,
All serious effort – no words flow,
Latin’s not in fashion now,
The solitariness of the meadow,
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
Crunching over morning snow.
My services to you I vow!
The twin lights of the carriage throw
I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Too often by a foreign word,
My style is rendered quite absurd
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Or the granite of the shore.
Nothing touched his feelings there,
And spirit finds creative fire.
Dear liberty and leisure.
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
As for finding ancient treasure
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Recalling many a lost love there
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Every dawn produces more
Carried in dream to that land where
He noticed nothing, did not care.
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
He lacked the passion and desire
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
For rural silence, where the lyre
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Far from Italy’s allure. 
Sentimental, free from care,
Onegin, to the theatre where
Then off to ramble in the park.
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Each falling there as they form
Recall the sea before a storm,
There I too strolled to and fro:
A single boat with outspread oars
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
A distant strand of singing soars;
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
He with lawyers round his ears,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
All in our sage’s cell appears
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
The storm that shook my soul for years
My pen I find no longer wanders,
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
How swift his letters from the heart!
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The Academic Dictionary. 
To give his life for poetry,
That dressing room, all solitary,
Of over-elaborate slander try
Await the touch, involuntary,
Pampered in eastern luxury
My soul preserved its memory
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Ingenious London without cease
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
The useful arts, can devise,
Did all that was required to please.
Here no conscience, there no sense,
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
The merchant and the beggar rise,
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Another slowly circling, so
I dare to write about it so,
A host of nymphs around her, so
He yawned inordinately, and so
Though the North affects me so.
I love their little feet, confess   
So youth’s happiness must pass,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Turning on the alien mass
A pedant in the details, no less. 
Was a very dandy in his dress,
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
Was it for you all that distress? 
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Rewards with its fond caress
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
The girls in fashionable dress,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
It’s peppered with them to excess,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
In the springtime on the moss,
Who in your verse is your goddess?’
Meanwhile in his morning dress
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 
Did full justice to the rest,
As his horses plough the dust,
Of history all turned to rust,
And my Eugene was free at last,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
He’d no desire to dig the dust
Parading there with all the rest,
Recalling romance of time past,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Garbed to the modern taste,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Beside some lines still incomplete.
And everything Parisian taste,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
For idleness and sense to waste –
Their absent masters to berate. 
Free, and in the flower of youth, 
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
The dead man buried priest and guests
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
So he’ll double the intensity
Ingenuous naivety,
His uncle’s frail mortality.  
Exhausted by society,
Pleased that they had done their duty.
The Muse gave it eternity,
His unique eccentricity,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
From my words take warning due,
The country caused the same ennui
As emptiness possessed his soul,
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Did I so long with painful ardour
In days of dream and ardour,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
To roam the forests green, so us,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Istomina stands, serious
The sky aglow above the Neva,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
My lips from hers will softly prove
Before the mirror, then would leave
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
My songs inspired by that crowd.
For whom among that jealous crowd,
Of someone other, never own
He even felt the urge to yawn,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
Or frighten with a glance or two
Were changing with the passing days.
In the morning of our days. 
All mankind’s malicious ways
In happiness, in idle ways,
Glad now that his former ways
I once spent my sweetest days?
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Since, foretelling to my gaze
-----------------------------

He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Since even he at times would sigh
For I stopped sinning long ago.
When talk was of some graver matter,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
Cannot but despise it all,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
The storm that shook my soul for years

As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
And with southern oceans nigh
A pedant in the details, no less. 
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
From every pleasure he retreated,
What traps he set for those abused!
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Carried in dream to that land where
China and bronzes fill the table,
With witticisms forged with guile,

Puffing the pillows, you contrive
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
Though the North affects me so.
I love their little feet, confess   
Go, little book: find Neva then,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
How often, on a summer’s night,
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.

I love youth’s frantic energy,
The rustling curtain as we breathe
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Recall the sea before a storm,
What more is needed? All agreed
As well-read, but opinionated,
Istomina stands, serious
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
By the will of Zeus the Just.
Recalling romance of time past,

While behind the window streams
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 
And turning morning into night
He who feels, is quickly taught
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
But Petersburg that restless heap
The useful arts, can devise,
Did all that was required to please.
To give his life for poetry,
Of over-elaborate slander try
Plus another hidden reason,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,

The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
Yet were they wholly innocent
But was dear Yevgeny content
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Treading the boards interminably,
A full three hours at least he’d spend
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
Now, when Eugene reached the age
Those years of hope and tender rage,

The dead man buried priest and guests
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
For two days it was all quite new,
Their dinner-table and their wife. 
To dream affection constantly
In order to be heard more clearly.
Here no conscience, there no sense,
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
To all unfaithful by and by,
Listen now to my sad voice.
All is still, only the guards
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,

His glance now bold, with tender art,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
Free, and in the flower of youth, 

All mankind’s malicious ways
I once spent my sweetest days?
Or end a letter with vale,
All attentive, or just mumble! 
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
I was born for quiet existence
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
Love in imagination,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
Great shelves of books he read and read
And to delight the sensual

While disillusion dogged him constantly,
Both had wearied of the game, 
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel, 
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
The child of luxury and delight.
His virulence, his scorn, alight
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 
Touching lightly on each theme,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
How I envied the waves then,

And daze the eyes of innocence,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Are you as you were? Have new
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
The circle claps to make all happen, 
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!

To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
Nature’s debt already paid.
Friends and enemies from afar
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
All serious effort – no words flow,
And gladly lived a life of debt
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie

Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
But still found nothing in his head,
Over the darkened stones instead,
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
How languid was his reticence,
With some fair Venetian face,
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
He drew a mourning veil of black.
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The coolness of the dark glades too,

That fashion or luxury supplies,
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
My darkened mind grew clear again,
(The place where we began, you see)
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Though I’m an adept at description,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,

Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
So clever, and so circumspect,
The object of his constancy;
Produced his hive of comedy,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Of how it lives, the what and why

The cause of which it’s time to seek,
Onegin and I planned to travel,
Though it’s true some woman may
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Orchestra already tiring,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
For conversation’s art created.
To tell iambic from trochee.
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
Freedom’s champion, ever strong

Then like a very sage could seem
I made a friend of Eugene then.
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
Far from Italy’s allure. 
Secure a secret assignation,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
All night, barely a foot away!
Three notes appear, on a tray.
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
Another day I bring to mind!
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
A distant strand of singing soars;

How I longed to be those seas
As though we can never treat
Though it adds to conversation,
We’ve all acquired some education
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Madman, could your heart forget?
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
From my words take warning due,
As emptiness possessed his soul,
Who in your verse is your goddess?’
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 

For idleness and sense to waste –
Their absent masters to berate. 
You left no trace, but loved instead
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
My country: exile was my lot,
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
You were the first, capricious belles,
To his stand the cabman drives,
There I too strolled to and fro:
A single boat with outspread oars
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
And far niente is my law.

That, search all Russia though,
Sang the maid on mountain high,
In ease and innocence I take
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
And fail to offer a word, to make
A walk beside the lonely lake,
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
For rural silence, where the lyre
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
A mazurka holds the crowd;
My songs inspired by that crowd.

You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
With that pale diaphanous light,
To pair Yevgeny and I,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
Ingenuous naivety,
His uncle’s frail mortality.  
Like women, books proved a deception,
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Down the streets where evening drowses,

To roam the forests green, so us,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
Was it for you all that distress? 
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Onegin has outpaced us all.  
One thing alone he studied well,
My lips from hers will softly prove
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,

In the end he too grew bored
Where my heart has long been smothered. 
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
Land of bewitchment! In past times
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
He had the gift of easy chatter,
Monotonous and varied, say,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
And our Katenin moreover
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,

Thank God no desire claimed him,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
On what spring flowers are you set?
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Content with life, took a stance,
Before you, let him now advance.
Satire’s most audacious master,
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
The dance-floor was my passion:
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Were changing with the passing days.
In the morning of our days. 

But there’s a risk in such fiction,
Generally their conversation
When shall I ever loose my tether?
In fact he soon received a letter
So, often, while he’s still abed,
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
In the springtime on the moss,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Then off to ramble in the park.
Each falling there as they form
For all those years long sped by?
Relinquished his inheritance,

In both our hearts a dying flame,
All poets, it seems to me,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
Here without an ounce of bother,
Which to visit first? No matter,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
Would join the literary bores,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
No need to keep reserves of gold.

God be thanked, some imitation,
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
As ardent glances swiftly fly
Guard your daughters most severely,
Where will my young idler call?
No, passion took no greater toll,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
No reason why a man of energy
Both had known the play of passion
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
In his memory tucked away.
And creditors had him at bay,

Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Another slowly circling, so
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Too often by a foreign word,
Today we know, truth to tell
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
Ingenious London without cease
Silent, chattering, as you please,
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
How utterly himself forgetting!
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now

Fill him with dissatisfaction,
To journalists for their consumption
Careless of fame, the brittle.
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Hating all this litigation,
Enters. The room is gyring,
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
That Onegin is not me, recall 
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Since with a cab hired from the stand,

His uncle lay at death’s door, better
This hostile climate where I wander,
My services to you I vow!
The twin lights of the carriage throw
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
No, for his early feelings faded,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
The little foot I touch it seems;
Where no face showed of Diana
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,

A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
My style is rendered quite absurd
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Their very presence causes spleen.
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
Recalling many a lost love there
Every dawn produces more
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,

In masculine attire displayed
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
The country caused the same ennui
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
Ah, they made me long despair
Though young he learnt the way to stir
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
The crush intense, the noise is loud.

Tired of the laughter of the age,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
Benediction we drank deep!
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
Of tortured youth and its desires
That occupied each night and day,
As at the feast he seemed to be?
To enter on the masquerade.
While both indoors and outside
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
On our northern snows, so gloomy,

The wealth of nations was his topic;
When inspired again, ecstatic,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Did I so long with painful ardour
In days of dream and ardour,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
The new ones simply antiquated,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
The house was filled with commotion,

It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
And when he wanted to refer
He with lawyers round his ears,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
Such our young dog’s meditation,
The science of the tender passion
Once more resigned to being idle
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
But later found it re-assuring,
In human rights, was here all wrong. 
He yawned inordinately, and so
So youth’s happiness must pass,

Across the literary stack,
So blameless in their intellect,
No, never in the fiercest fires
He notes the boxes, serried places,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
The corpse on a table laid,
Content forever with their life,
On any fond face on this stage,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Borne away to change at home. 

The old ones utterly out-dated,
How poisonous the words he used!
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Alas, on every stray amusement
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Or the granite of the shore.
And, exiled for that very thing
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Let us all follow his example!
His unique eccentricity,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.

He chose – a more than worthy goal,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
To pass a note of assignation.
As some suspicious aged devil,
You’re curious for every detail,
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
And captive girls by the Salgira,
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,

To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
Though I’ve consulted frequently
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
An instant hails the entrechat,
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
In the water’s smooth still glass,
No longer even stirred his will, 
A birthday party, here a ball.
Twists her waist one way, another,
His father had a fine career

A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
With staple products its supply,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
The censors must have work to do.
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
His labour, torment and delight,
His springtime occupation bright,

Like prisoners released in sleep,
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
The Muse gave it eternity,
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Where you too were nourished or
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
Better to hurry to the ball,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
Threads the rows among the feet,

And ignominiously repeat
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Did full justice to the rest,
As his horses plough the dust,
And we can all display éclat,
Glass on glass to drench the heat
Latin’s not in fashion now,
The solitariness of the meadow,
And though a womaniser fine,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Roam beneath my African sky,

One foot planted, pirouettes
Askance his opera-glass now centres
And spirit finds creative fire.
Dear liberty and leisure.
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Pay attention now I beg you,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
The safest place for a lover
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Each man to his own ideas,

The careful spouse as much his man,
It summons up respect, one can
Enchantment fails such men as he,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
That dressing room, all solitary,
Await the touch, involuntary,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Blue columns rising over folk,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
Beside some lines still incomplete.

Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
While weary servants half-awake,
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
His heart consumed with regret
Your question ringing in my ear,
Glistening, an obedient tear!

The jealous ladies whisper sins.
Within its glow no interest dawns,
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
With some ready epigram. 
I’m ready now for chapter two.
Or frighten with a glance or two
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
And kept dull boredom far away –

I read a lot, I doze a little,
His epigrams topped up with bile. 
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
Then he turns away – and yawns,
Has opened up his serving flap.
When will my wings begin to soar?
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,

Her way again in soulful flight?
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
But where, in what deserted strand
So unapproachable, serene,
Then his father passed away,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Deep in all things economic
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,

And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
Silently impart love’s teaching!
As for finding ancient treasure
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
And carpeted voluptuousness.
Rewards with its fond caress
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
He who had never once concealed
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
A bit of this a bit of that,
That sitting by the bed all day,

No Russian terms exist, confess,
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Exhausted by society,
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Three houses offer a soirée:
And so in careless rapture I
Meet my hero of romance,
I hear the magic of your voice!
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Leaning, musing pensively,

Not for long were lovely ladies
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Sentimental, free from care,
Onegin, to the theatre where
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
He would neglect and then abandon.
It’s not my job to work them through.
Silently to yawn and sigh
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 
But as for genius, if any,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
Now free, my verse no longer feared 

Were ever dearest friends of his,
That I have here daubed my portrait,
Before the mirror, then would leave
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
He knew enough I would allow
Past the doorman like an arrow,
How swift his letters from the heart!
Left his father, stunned by theory,
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
First Madame, you understand,

For whom among that jealous crowd,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
It’s peppered with them to excess,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
On the granite parapet,
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
Say farewell without delay.
From Romulus to our own day,
He lacked the passion and desire
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Taught him everything by whim,

My pen I find no longer wanders,
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
On what the state relies, he told,
He’d no desire to dig the dust
Parading there with all the rest,
I still remember, and it seems
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
To the magic bow in thrall,
O country life! I like you all,
I dare to write about it so,
A host of nymphs around her, so

Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
But, God, what tedium to sample
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
Finding it small deprivation,
All chained to their pre-conception,
Again imagination blazes,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
To read an epigraph, and might
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight

Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
(Critics stern, acute as any)
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
To any but ourselves alone. 
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Endless bottles of sparkling wine

Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Call to each other in the yards,
At that time, and retired from view,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Overcome with wit and passion,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Then Monsieur taught the child
Yawning the while as he raced,
A London dandy safely classed

Of someone other, never own
He saw as clear as the dawn,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
While drowned by frantic violins
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
And everything Parisian taste,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 

The girls in fashionable dress,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Of history all turned to rust,
And my Eugene was free at last,
In happiness, in idle ways,
Glad now that his former ways
All in our sage’s cell appears
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
The merchant and the beggar rise,

Friends and friendship were confusing,
Faithlessness was not amusing
Pampered in eastern luxury
My soul preserved its memory
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Turning on the alien mass
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Crunching over morning snow.
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Garbed to the modern taste,

Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
The Academic Dictionary. 
From his uncle’s man, to say
His beaver-collar shines away, 
Of lovely woman, freakish fop. 
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Shall I depict with faithful pen
I too cast off the social burden,
But now my friends I often hear,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 

I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
More than once in white night-cap
Always gave three balls a year
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
The coachmen by the fire free
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
How passionate his eloquence,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
So he’ll double the intensity
To his rivals, that whole set,
And died with all he owed unmet.

Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
The punctilious German baker,
In winter, resting on the fender,
Heads, in profile, edges crop, 
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Like a shadow, or a wife. 
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
I liked his face, his manner too,
-----------------------------

‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
Falling ill like that, and dying;
It summons up respect, one can
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Let us all follow his example!
But, God, what tedium to sample
That sitting by the bed all day,
All night, barely a foot away!
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’

2.

Such our young dog’s meditation,
As his horses plough the dust,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Meet my hero of romance,
Before you, let him now advance.
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Where you too were nourished or
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
There I too strolled to and fro:
Though the North affects me so.

3.

His father had a fine career
And gladly lived a life of debt
Always gave three balls a year
And died with all he owed unmet.
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
First Madame, you understand,
Then Monsieur taught the child
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Taught him everything by whim,
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Then off to ramble in the park.

4. 

Now, when Eugene reached the age
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
And my Eugene was free at last,
A London dandy safely classed
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Into society he rode.
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Did all that was required to please.
What more is needed? All agreed
That here was wit and charm indeed.




5.

We’ve all acquired some education
A bit of this a bit of that,
God be thanked, some imitation,
And we can all display éclat,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
(Critics stern, acute as any)
As well-read, but opinionated,
For conversation’s art created.
He had the gift of easy chatter,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Then like a very sage could seem
When talk was of some graver matter,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
With some ready epigram. 

6.

Latin’s not in fashion now,
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
He knew enough I would allow
To read an epigraph, and might
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Or end a letter with vale,
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
As for finding ancient treasure
He’d no desire to dig the dust
Of history all turned to rust,
But kept the juiciest stories ever
From Romulus to our own day,
In his memory tucked away.

7.

He lacked the passion and desire
To give his life for poetry,
Despite all efforts, or aspire
To tell iambic from trochee.
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Deep in all things economic
The wealth of nations was his topic;
On what the state relies, he told,
Of how it lives, the what and why
With staple products its supply,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.

8.

The wealth of things my Yevgeny
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
But as for genius, if any,
One thing alone he studied well,
His springtime occupation bright,
His labour, torment and delight,
That occupied each night and day,
And kept dull boredom far away –
The science of the tender passion
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
And, exiled for that very thing
Plus another hidden reason,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Far from Italy’s allure. 

9/10.

From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
All attentive, or just mumble! 
How languid was his reticence,
How passionate his eloquence,
How swift his letters from the heart!
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
How utterly himself forgetting!
His glance now bold, with tender art,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Glistening, an obedient tear!

11.

How skilfully he’d feign the new,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
Or frighten with a glance or two
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Ingenuous naivety,
Await the touch, involuntary,
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Secure a secret assignation,
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Silently impart love’s teaching!




12.

Though young he learnt the way to stir
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
And when he wanted to refer
To his rivals, that whole set,
How poisonous the words he used!
What traps he set for those abused!
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
Were ever dearest friends of his,
The careful spouse as much his man,
Betrayed, a husband from a novel, 
As some suspicious aged devil,
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Content forever with their life,
Their dinner-table and their wife. 

13-15.

So, often, while he’s still abed,
Three notes appear, on a tray.
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
Three houses offer a soirée:
A birthday party, here a ball.
Where will my young idler call?
Which to visit first? No matter,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Parading there with all the rest,
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 

16.

As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
His beaver-collar shines away, 
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 




17.

Glass on glass to drench the heat
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
This ruthless critic, legislator,
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
To all unfaithful by and by,
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
Onegin, to the theatre where
He breathes the air of freedom, at
An instant hails the entrechat,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
In order to be heard more clearly.

18.

Land of bewitchment! In past times
Satire’s most audacious master,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
And our Katenin moreover
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Produced his hive of comedy,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.

My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
Listen now to my sad voice.
Are you as you were? Have new
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
Her way again in soulful flight?
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
On any fond face on this stage,
Turning on the alien mass
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Silently to yawn and sigh
For all those years long sped by?




20.

The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
The circle claps to make all happen, 
The rustling curtain as we breathe
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
To the magic bow in thrall,
A host of nymphs around her, so
Another slowly circling, so
Istomina stands, serious
One foot planted, pirouettes
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.

21.

Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Threads the rows among the feet,
Askance his opera-glass now centres
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
He notes the boxes, serried places,
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
Didelot too is quite the bore.’

22. 

Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
Treading the boards interminably,
While weary servants half-awake,
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
While both indoors and outside
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
The coachmen by the fire free
Their absent masters to berate. 
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
Borne away to change at home. 

23.

That dressing room, all solitary,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Ingenious London without cease
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
And everything Parisian taste,
The useful arts, can devise,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
For idleness and sense to waste –
All in our sage’s cell appears
Our philosopher of eighteen years.

24.

A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
China and bronzes fill the table,
And to delight the sensual
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
In human rights, was here all wrong. 

25.

No reason why a man of energy
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
A pedant in the details, no less. 
A full three hours at least he’d spend
Before the mirror, then would leave
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
In masculine attire displayed
To enter on the masquerade.

26.

Garbed to the modern taste,
You’re curious for every detail,
And for you, knowledgeable race,
I might try to tell the whole tale,
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
Though I’m an adept at description,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 
My style is rendered quite absurd
Too often by a foreign word,
It’s peppered with them to excess,
Though I’ve consulted frequently
The Academic Dictionary. 

27.

That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
Better to hurry to the ball,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Onegin has outpaced us all.  
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
The twin lights of the carriage throw
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
While behind the window streams
A flow of silhouetted stills,
Heads, in profile, edges crop, 
Of lovely woman, freakish fop. 

28.

Past the doorman like an arrow,
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Orchestra already tiring,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
As ardent glances swiftly fly
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.

29.

In days of dream and ardour,
The dance-floor was my passion:
The safest place for a lover
To pass a note of assignation.
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
My services to you I vow!
Pay attention now I beg you,
From my words take warning due,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
I dare to write about it so,
For I stopped sinning long ago.

30.

Alas, on every stray amusement
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
Yet were they wholly innocent
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I love youth’s frantic energy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
The girls in fashionable dress,
I love their little feet, confess   
That, search all Russia though,
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
Ah, they made me long despair
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
I still remember, and it seems
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 




31.

But where, in what deserted strand
Madman, could your heart forget?
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
On what spring flowers are you set?
Pampered in eastern luxury
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
You left no trace, but loved instead
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
And carpeted voluptuousness.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
My country: exile was my lot,
Was it for you all that distress? 
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.

32.

Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
In winter, resting on the fender,
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
Or the granite of the shore.

33.

Recall the sea before a storm,
How I envied the waves then,
Each falling there as they form
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
How I longed to be those seas
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
Did I so long with painful ardour
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Or her breast, filled with languor;
No, passion took no greater toll,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!




34.

Another day I bring to mind!
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
The little foot I touch it seems;
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.

35.

And my Onegin? Half-asleep
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
But Petersburg that restless heap
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
The merchant and the beggar rise,
To his stand the cabman drives,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Crunching over morning snow.
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Blue columns rising over folk,
The punctilious German baker,
More than once in white night-cap
Has opened up his serving flap.

36.

Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
And turning morning into night
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
The child of luxury and delight.
He wakes at noon, or even later,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
Monotonous and varied, say,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
But was dear Yevgeny content
Free, and in the flower of youth, 
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
As at the feast he seemed to be?




37. 

No, for his early feelings faded,
Exhausted by society,
Not for long were lovely ladies
The object of his constancy;
Faithlessness was not amusing
Friends and friendship were confusing,
Since even he at times would sigh
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
And fail to offer a word, to make
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
And though a womaniser fine,
In the end he too grew bored
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.

38.

The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Thank God no desire claimed him,
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
He noticed nothing, did not care.

39-42.

You were the first, capricious belles,
He would neglect and then abandon.
Today we know, truth to tell
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
Though it’s true some woman may
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Generally their conversation
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
So clever, and so circumspect,
So blameless in their intellect,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
So unapproachable, serene,
Their very presence causes spleen.




43.

You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
Over the darkened stones instead,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
From every pleasure he retreated,
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
Would join the literary bores,
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
All serious effort – no words flow,
He yawned inordinately, and so
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 

44.

As emptiness possessed his soul,
Once more resigned to being idle
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Great shelves of books he read and read
But still found nothing in his head,
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
Here no conscience, there no sense,
All chained to their pre-conception,
The old ones utterly out-dated,
The new ones simply antiquated,
Like women, books proved a deception,
Across the literary stack,
He drew a mourning veil of black.

45.

I too cast off the social burden,
At that time, and retired from view,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
I liked his face, his manner too,
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
His unique eccentricity,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
Both had known the play of passion
Both had wearied of the game, 
In both our hearts a dying flame,
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
All mankind’s malicious ways
In the morning of our days. 




46.

He who’s lived, he who’s thought
Cannot but despise it all,
He who feels, is quickly taught
The pain of time lost, past recall:
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
Though it adds to conversation,
Lends it charm, intense delight.
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
But later found it re-assuring,
His virulence, his scorn, alight
With witticisms forged with guile,
His epigrams topped up with bile. 

47.

How often, on a summer’s night,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
With that pale diaphanous light,
Where no face showed of Diana
In the water’s smooth still glass,
Recalling romance of time past,
Recalling many a lost love there
Sentimental, free from care,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Benediction we drank deep!
Like prisoners released in sleep,
To roam the forests green, so us,
Carried in dream to that land where
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 

48.

His heart consumed with regret
Leaning, musing pensively,
On the granite parapet,
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
All is still, only the guards
Call to each other in the yards,
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
A single boat with outspread oars
Swims across the drowsy stream,
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
A distant strand of singing soars;
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.




49.

Waves of the distant Adriatic,
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
When inspired again, ecstatic,
I hear the magic of your voice!
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
With some fair Venetian face,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
My lips from hers will softly prove
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.

50.

When shall I ever loose my tether?
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
When will my wings begin to soar?
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
This hostile climate where I wander,
And with southern oceans nigh
Roam beneath my African sky,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where my heart has long been smothered. 

51.

Onegin and I planned to travel,
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Then his father passed away,
And creditors had him at bay,
Each man to his own ideas,
He with lawyers round his ears,
Hating all this litigation,
Content with life, took a stance,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Finding it small deprivation,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
His uncle’s frail mortality.  




52.

In fact he soon received a letter
From his uncle’s man, to say
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
Say farewell without delay.
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Yawning the while as he raced,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
(The place where we began, you see)
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
The corpse on a table laid,
Nature’s debt already paid.

53.

The house was filled with commotion,
Friends and enemies from afar
Had called to show their true devotion,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
The dead man buried priest and guests
Did full justice to the rest,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
He who had never once concealed
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
Glad now that his former ways
Were changing with the passing days.

54.

For two days it was all quite new,
The solitariness of the meadow,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
No longer even stirred his will, 
He even felt the urge to yawn,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
The country caused the same ennui
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Like a shadow, or a wife. 




55.

I was born for quiet existence
For rural silence, where the lyre
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
And spirit finds creative fire.
In ease and innocence I take
A walk beside the lonely lake,
And far niente is my law.
Every dawn produces more
Dear liberty and leisure.
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
In happiness, in idle ways,
I once spent my sweetest days?

56.

Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
O country life! I like you all,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
That Onegin is not me, recall 
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Of over-elaborate slander try
To pair Yevgeny and I,
And ignominiously repeat
That I have here daubed my portrait,
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
As though we can never treat
Of someone other, never own
To any but ourselves alone. 

57.

All poets, it seems to me,
Love in imagination,
To dream affection constantly
Was once my sole preoccupation.
My soul preserved its memory
The Muse gave it eternity,
And so in careless rapture I
Sang the maid on mountain high,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
But now my friends I often hear,
Your question ringing in my ear,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
For whom among that jealous crowd,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?




58.

‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Rewards with its fond caress
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Who in your verse is your goddess?’
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
So he’ll double the intensity
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
But I was mute, foolish in the game.

59.

Love faded then the Muse appeared,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Now free, my verse no longer feared 
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
The storm that shook my soul for years
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 

60.

I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
It’s not my job to work them through.
The censors must have work to do.
To journalists for their consumption
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
Go, little book: find Neva then,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
